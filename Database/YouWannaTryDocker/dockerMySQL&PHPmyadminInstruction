FIRST: run two container

＊if u already have local mysql server runing, please to stop that. 「sudo service mysql stop」maybe help.


>>> docker run --name mysql_db_server -it -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=1234 -d mysql:5.7

>>> docker run --name myadmin --link mysql_db_server:db -p 8080:80 -d phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin


SECOND:

catch mysql container's id by execute command : docker ps

>>> docker exec -it container's_id bash

---enter into mysql container

>>> mysql -u root -p

>>> 1234

>>> create database literature;


THIRD:

Synchronize this database by executing some commands in Django project folder.

>>> cd ChineseLiterature/

>>> find . -path "*/migrations/*.py" -not -name "__init__.py" -delete
>>> find . -path "*/migrations/*.pyc"  -delete

>>> python manage.py makemigrations
>>> python manage.py migrate

Now, django ORM help us to create tables we need according to models.py!

And, we can execute those writeDataToDatabase_*.py to see the conditions about inserting data into tables!

(Approximately 40 minutes it will take us to complete four tables. Under the SSD disk circumstance, time consuming will be declined! )


THIRD:

after completing data insert,

>>> cd ChineseLiterature/

>>> python manage.py runserver

Now, we can enjoy service by typing 「localhost:8000/bookInfo/」!
